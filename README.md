# Code Refactor of Horiseon homepage

## Description

In this project, I refactored the original HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon web page.  This refactor increased accessibility by adding alt text to the site's images, as well as cleaning up the semantic elements and restructuring the code to make it more understandable and organized.
